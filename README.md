# GlobalRoutes API 🚍🌎

Welcome to **GlobalRoutes**, an API designed to help you find public transportation routes, allowing you to travel from one point to another within any country. 🧳🗺️

## Features 🛠️

- **Route search:** Find the best routes for traveling using public transportation anywhere in the world. 🌍
- **Global coverage:** Works for any country that has public transportation data.
- **Own database:** The API creates and manages its own database to store and quickly access route information. 🗄️

## Requirements ⚙️

Before you start, make sure you have the following installed:

- **Visual Studio** (any version compatible with .NET) 💻
- **PostgreSQL** to manage the database 🗂️

## Installation 📦

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/globalroutes.git
    cd globalroutes

2. **Open the project in Visual Studio:**
    ```bash
    Open the GlobalRoutes.sln file directly in Visual Studio.

3. **Update the PostgreSQL connection string:**
    
    Go to the API's configuration file (appsettings.json) and update the connection string with your PostgreSQL instance details:
    ```bash
    {
        "ConnectionStrings": {
        "development": "Host=localhost;Port=5432;Database=globalroutesdb;User Id=YourUser;Password=YourPassword",
        },
    }
    
4. **Migrate the database:**
Run the migrations to generate the necessary tables in the database (This may take a few minutes to complete):

    dotnet ef database update --project GlobalRoutes.Infrastructure.Migrations --startup-project GlobalRoutesApi

## Usage 🏃‍♂️

With the database configured and the API ready, you can start the server

## Main Endpoints 📍 (Developing)
    ```bash
    GET /routes: Search available routes between two points and time. 🧭
    POST /routes: Create a new route in the database. ✏️

For full documentation on all the endpoints, you can check the Swagger documentation generated by the API when it's running (usually at http://localhost:5000/swagger). 📜
